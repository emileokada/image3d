\section{Introduction}
As mathematicians we rarely get the chance to get our hands dirty and make something.
In this project however, I've had the chance to work both with the mathematics behind reconstructing objects from their projections, and the engineering involved in making my own 3D scanning rig.

\vspace*{-10cm}
\section{Reconstruction from projections}
The mathematics for reconstructing 2D objects is very simple and generalizes nicely to 3D objects too.
Let $D$ be a subset of the plane.
In this project we consider the projections corresponding to the shadow of the object caused by incident light rays coming in at an angle $\theta$ to the horizontal.

\begin{itemize}
\item \dmin model (Galli-Resta et al., 1997) adapted to bivariate case
  (Fig.~3).  Size of homotypic exclusion zones drawn from a Normal
  distribution (mean $\pm$ s.d.); heterotypic exclusion zone fixed at
  soma diameter.
  
\item Model parameters varied to find best fit to real maps (M623 and
  W81s) for:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $L(t)$ --- mean (scaled) number of cells within distance
    $t$ of a cell. L functions are cumulative versions of DRP
    (Rodieck, 1991).
  \item regularity index --- mean/s.d. of the distance to
    nearest-neighbour.
    
  \item  fraction of $1^{st}$, $2^{nd}$, $3^{rd}$, or all,
    nearest neighbours of opposite type.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\vspace*{5mm} \textbf{Figure 3}: \textit{Bivariate \dmin model. On and
  off-centre cells are initially located randomly throughout the
  array.  All cells are then moved within the array according to the
  following procedure.  A cell is selected (1) and repositioned
  randomly (e.g.  at 4) avoiding homotypic exclusion zones (dotted
  circles; 2) and smaller heterotypic zones (solid red circles, which
  are cell bodies of opposite type; 3).  One sweep consists of moving
  all cells in the array once.  Cells are moved for many sweeps to
  allow the patterns to stabilise.}

\section{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Beta RGC maps can be simulated with limited interactions
  between the two mosaics.  Heterotypic interactions are limited to
  preventing somal overlap.
  
\item Confirms general principle that mosaics are \textit{functionally
    independent} of each other (Rockhill et al., 2000).
  
\item Previous model suggested fixed dependency between two mosaics
  (Zhan \& Troy, 2000); may be by-product of model implementation.

%% \item The same mechanism may account for bivariate horizontal cell mosaics.
  
\item Functional implications of independence in arrays?

\item Caveats: model works with adult maps (ignoring developmental
  processes, such as cell death).  Limited data sets (n=2).
  Interactions between dendritic refinement and soma positioning unknown.
